            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>When I was lately in <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">About <hi>May,</hi> 1647. M. <hi>Bodin</hi> Mini ster of the <hi>Bath.</hi>
               </note> as I passed by <hi>Pauls</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, I spyed a friend in a Stationer's Shop, who, after sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes passed, with some briefe discourse of the times, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed mee of some late newes out of <hi>Italy</hi> arrived at his hands in a Letter from a friend, concerning a meeting not very long since among the Popish Priests, and others; whereat, a question being put, (How to reduce <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome?</hi>) after many had risen up &amp; given in their best advice, An antient Fryar begins to speak in such a manner; <hi>It is not Fire and Faggot, not the Sword, not Powder-plots, that can effect it;</hi> you thought well on another meanes, <hi>viz.</hi> to worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gaine in the King and Nobles; <hi>but no way, in my judgement like this,</hi> viz. <hi>Set the Puritan against the Preacher and the worke is done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I then thought, and (as I remember) said, They have now their work done to their hands; which is their master-plot and grand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, to pull down more by their policy then ever they could throw down with their pieces of battery. You see the Popish eggs are not all addle, if one device doth not, another may, and will take, and reach as far as God will permit, but further it cannot. This is one, the other followes.</p>
            <p>Calling to see a friend at <hi>Putny,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Minister of <hi>Barns.</hi>
               </note> he told me of a Merchat in the same house then present, who related unto him an History, or rather some late experience then Intelligence, then (as he said) not a week old.</p>
            <p>Few dayes before he was walking in <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">About some part of <hi>May.</hi>
               </note> and seeing a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude at a doore, he asked who preached there? A woman answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, One whom they count an Anabaptist, but he is a very Good Able Man. He resolv'd to stay and heare, and upon hearing of the Sermon, he was much taken with the mans parts and abilities: all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:160537:7"/>done, he tooke more notice of the man, thinking he had seene him of late beyond the Seas, and, taking him by the hand, salutes him, Sir, doe you not remember me? The Preacher denyes that ever he saw him. At length, he so describes himselfe, and writes him as it were a Copy of the place, time, company, in such Characters as he admired, and hereupon said, Sir, If you betray me, &amp;c.‚Äîputting his hand to his neck. But, I wonder, said the Merchant, how you came to pray and preach so vehemently for puritie of Ordinances, &amp;c. just as some among us.‚ÄîHe answered, Our College can reach any of parts, that in a fortnight. The Merchant againe, Sir, but you are not of this judgement and way, as you pretend here, are you? No, saith he, but you know <hi>Divide &amp; Impera.</hi> This Merchant, as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster informed me, said, This was a Jesuit whom he saw in <hi>Rome</hi> sew moneths agoe.</p>
            <p>By what I have read concerning the Principles and practices of these men, I have ground to imagine. There is not one Sect or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this or any other Realme, which some or other of them doe not pretend to be of and joyne with, if so be they may hereby play their owne game, and make others drive all day long in their mill blindfold, to advance the Catholike Cause here and elsewhere. They cannot fish but in troubled waters, every one can tell how good fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they must needs find here, if they had none elsewhere.</p>
            <p>I am sorry I took no more punctuall notice of them, who informed me concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Jesuit, who playd his game so well, that he got into a Living of late yeares, and kept undiscovered, untill one travelling on the way, being forced to lye in that Town, and resolving to hear one on the Lords day in that place, heard him, and (thinking he knew him) would have had him come to his Inne, but the noise of this invitation deprived them of an afternoon Sermon, the Preacher being fled. It's not unknown to him that knows any thing of the Jesuits doctrines, that they use to train up many to seduce and deceive as well as to kill and destroy.</p>
            <p>Having bin excited, partly by a friend who is a wel-wisher, but more by my hearty wel-wishes to, and desires of the glory of God and the publique good, I could not but hold forth an Item for my Country-mens admonition, and (If I live doe no more for them, which is knowne best unto God, and him onely) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to <hi>beware of the Jesuits</hi> within (lust, &amp; a deceitfull heart) and without, <hi>viz.</hi> those brats of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or rather fire-brands, that kindle distractions in Church and State all the world over;<note place="margin">8 Joh.</note> who descend more remotely from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devill, who is the father of a lye, and a murderer <hi>ab initio,</hi> abominable for antiquitie; but more immediately derive their pedigree from <hi>Ignatius Loiola</hi> that carried fire in his name, whom some of the Jesuits<note n="*" place="margin">Salmanassar.</note> doe acknowledge to have bin by nature fierce, hard, and cruel.
